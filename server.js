PORT = 8000

/* 
	TODO: 
		01 
		write any code for serverside listning on PORT. 


		02
		When the program is working fine, then try to think 
		in a different way how NOT to hardcode the PORT inside server.js 
		use somekind of global configuration outside the node process
		When you need to deploy or host your app in a production server, you
		will discover a lot of port conflicts,  
		It's up to you how to solve this issue, if you do not want to solve it now
		you will be forced to solved it the time you need to deploy in production :-)
